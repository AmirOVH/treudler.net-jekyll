These are the jekyll source files of my personal website.

### How tu build

``bundle exec jekyll build --destination /var/www/html/ --watch --verbose``

I'm building this on my Raspberry Pi and uploading it to BunnyCDN afterwards. The built website is fully static and doesn't contain and dynamic/php content.
