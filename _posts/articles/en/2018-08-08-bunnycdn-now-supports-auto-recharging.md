## BunnyCDN now supports auto-recharging of your account balance

BunnyCDN recently announced a new feature which allows you to auto-recharge your account when the balance drops below a specific amount.

Do do so, [login](https://bunnycdn.com/dashboard/user/login) to your account and click on "Billing" on the left side menu, or simply click [this link](https://bunnycdn.com/dashboard/billing) to directly go to the Billing settings.

Here you can find the new Auto-Recharge function.

You can choose any amount from a predefined menu. This will also change the currently needed balance of your account.
