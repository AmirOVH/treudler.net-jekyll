# Apps I'm using in my daily life

I often get asked "what tool do you use to do xy?" so I decided to create this page and showoff everything I'm using on my PC and Mobile.

This page is always under construction and I'm adding more and more. It has been last updated on **30.03.2018**.

I'll start off with

## [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/)

Used to **capture and upload screenshots, videos, gifs and files to my own webserver** without ftp/sftp.

ShareX is *open-source and free to use*.

My ShareX relays on a file named ``upload.php`` which contains a simple passphrase to authenticate with my server. I'll post a tutorial on how to configure this in the future.
Capturing a gif, desktop recording or screenshot can be done with hotkeys or by right-clicking on the ShareX icon. Additionally you can right-click on any file and upload it to your webserver.
You have the ability to auto-rename the file on upload and choose a specific location for all file types, e.g. ``/shared/screenshots/`` for sreenshots and ``/shared/gif/`` (that's what I'm doing).

## [MS Remotedesktop](https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/store/p/microsoft-remotedesktop/9wzdncrfj3ps)

Used to **connect to my local PC from anywhere**.

Microsoft Remote Desktop is *free to use*.

I'm using the mobile app to connect to my PC from whereever I am. The mobile app is available for all wide-used operating systems. There're multiple open-source linux alternatives to connect to your computer from your linux laptop running ubuntu or any other desktop environment. Your PC has to run around the clock, 24/7 - automatically waking it up from standby isn't possible through RDP.

## [Discord](https://discordapp.com/)

I don't think that I have to explain anything. Discord has replaced Skype and TeamSpeak. 

## [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)

## [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)

## [Nixstats](https://www.nixstats.com/)

## [Smokeping](https://oss.oetiker.ch/smokeping/)

## [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/)
