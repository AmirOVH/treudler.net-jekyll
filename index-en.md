Hi there, I'm Joshua, age 21, riding my cyclocross roadbike nearly 24/7/365. Since a couple of months, I'm doing longer bikepacking trips within Europe. I'm trying to write a blog post for every trip, so enjoy reading :)

I'm also working as Webmaster for different projects, including <a href="//cor-forum.de" target="_blank">CoR Forum</a> and some others.

This page is also available in [Deutsch](deutsch.html), but I don't really maintain the german version at this time as I'm busy with other things.
