Hi there, I'm Joshua, 21yo, riding my cyclocross roadbike nearly 24/7/365. Since a couple of months, I'm doing longer bikepacking trips within Europe. I'm trying to write a blog post for every trip, so enjoy reading :)

I'm also working as Webmaster for different projects, including <a href="//cor-forum.de" target="_blank">CoR Forum</a> and some others that I don't want to mention.

A short time ago, I started growing Walking Sticks and Ghost Insects, <a href="/stick.html">check Livestream here</a>.

<h2>My latest blog posts</h2>

{% include list-category-posts.html lang=page.lang category="articles" %}

This page is also available in [Deutsch](deutsch.html), but I don't really maintain the german version at this time as I'm busy with other things.
