*Dear customers,  
Dear friends,  
Dear team,*

As you're aware, our support response time has increased a lot in the past couple of months. First of all I need to point out that Treudler has not deadpooled or gone bankrupt (greetings to LowEndTalk).

I have done everything alone, indeed my great team helped me with the community, with tickets and some little technical work, but that's not even 10% of the total work. Really special thanks to Jarno, without you in our team Treudler would have shutdowned much earlier. Also thanks Emile, Ripen James, Ricky and James, plus my much loved Senior Customers. You really made my past year complete. Also I wanna thank Robin, who has co-founded this company with me, even if he has left Treudler in late 2016 already.

I took care of over 2700 customers in a period of nearly 3 years. I made profit, which was always re-invested into new host systems for our virtual servers (plus some Steam games for myself).

Since mid of 2017 I have been looking for someone who could take over Treudler as it is. The main problem is that I'm not trusting my lastname to anyone. Before someone else scrapes it, I decided to shut everything down. Please do not send me emails asking if you can takeover my customers. One of the many reasons for this quick shutdown is that I just don't want to work on Treudler anymore. I want to focus on my reallife and personal education. My near friends and customers will understand that.

I did not need any real help or anything like that, I was not overstrained, it just took me too much time and effort to work on everything.

I'm actually very proud for what I’ve done in my age of only 20\. With distance, Treudler has been one of the best OVH resellers in the world.

Thank you,

## Looking for a new provider?

Let me give you one advice: **Don't rent Virtual Servers!**  
**Public Cloud is the future**, billed per-hour and highly flexible.

There're multiple **major** Public Cloud providers running own datacenters out there. My recommendations are listed below, no affiliate links.
