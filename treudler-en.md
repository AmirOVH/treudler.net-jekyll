## What is Treudler?

It has been a few months since I closed Treudler, so there is a chance that you don't know what it is at all.
Treudler is my lastname, and I named my hosting company after it. So on this page: Treudler was a/my hosting company.

Earlier in 2015 I wanted to found my own company and at the end of September 2015 I registered my self-employment with the city of Geestland.

A friend of mine, Robin Werner, joined me in early 2016 and I included him in my plans. Robin left Treudler for private reasons at the end of 2016.

After a beta time of a few weeks, we launched our first offers in May 2016 and collected about 20 customers by the fall of 2016.

Through a friend, in December 2016, I came up with the idea of ​​reselling OVH's Game DDoS protection. This allowed us to achieve a rapid customer growth of 2-5 customers per day.

Until October 2016, I used Proxmox to manage the virtual servers in conjunction with WHMCS as a billing system - I had to manually (re)install servers every day, which was kinda annoying and a big issue for us. From then until about December 2016, I used SolusVM, so servers could be delivered in a few seconds and fully automated. From February 2017, only Virtualizor was used, because the team behind SolusVM lagged behind in development and Virtualizor offered some great additional features.

In the summer of 2017, I was accused of using a self-created license for Virtualizor. I then applied as an official partner of Virtualizor and became one of Softaculous's largest licensing partners.

Between April and Autumn 2017, I offered free web hosting with Plesk, which was mostly abused for phishing, so that this project disappeared quickly back into the ground.

In 2017, I offered Game Server for testing. Including games like Minecraft, GTA and Counter Strike. However, due to the huge effort involved, the project quickly came to an end.

My team was always small-sized and everyone worked for free.

## Open letter to my customers, friends and team

<br>
* Update 28.02.2018: Company registration revoked  
* Update 11.03.2018: Remaining Virtual Servers deleted  
* Update 14.03.2018: Final Profit-Loss-Statement was submitted and customer database has been archived in [C14](//www.online.net/en/c14)

*Dear customers,  
Dear friends,  
Dear team,*

As you're aware, our support response time has increased a lot in the past couple of months. First of all I need to point out that Treudler has not deadpooled or gone bankrupt (greetings to LowEndTalk).

I have done everything alone, indeed my great team helped me with the community, with tickets and some little technical work, but that's not even 10% of the total work. Really special thanks to Jarno, without you in our team Treudler would have shutdowned much earlier. Also thanks Emile, Ripen James, Ricky and James, plus my much loved Senior Customers. You really made my past year complete. Also I wanna thank Robin, who has co-founded this company with me, even if he has left Treudler in late 2016 already.

I took care of over 2700 customers in a period of nearly 3 years. I made profit, which was always re-invested into new host systems for our virtual servers (plus some Steam games for myself).

Since mid of 2017 I have been looking for someone who could take over Treudler as it is. The main problem is that I'm not trusting my lastname to anyone. Before someone else scrapes it, I decided to shut everything down. Please do not send me emails asking if you can takeover my customers. One of the many reasons for this quick shutdown is that I just don't want to work on Treudler anymore. I want to focus on my reallife and personal education. My near friends and customers will understand that.

I did not need any real help or anything like that, I was not overstrained, it just took me too much time and effort to work on everything.

I'm actually very proud for what I’ve done in my age of only 20\. With distance, Treudler has been one of the best OVH resellers in the world.

Thank you,
